What did I do last time?
	- Integrated FileSystem with IoHandler with commands
	- Worked on design of basics commands, Cd, Echo, Ls
	- Finished cat, mkdir.
	- tested Jshell with basic commands mentioned above

What do I plan to do now?
    - Finish push pop, tree
    - add necessary exceptions
    - more final testing and fixing on whole Jshell
	- Check Google coding style on all of my files

Am I blocked on anything?
