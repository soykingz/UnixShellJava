What did I do last time?
	- Modified FileSystem to follow singleton design
	- Added exceptions in FileSystem
	- Discussed with liangho2 for an updated design for Shell, commands (using reflection), and JUnit tests

What do I plan to do now?
	- Finish adding Exceptions in Directory
	- Update Directory documentations
	- Create FileSystem Interface
	- Update Existing commands, work on new command if possible
	- JUnit test on commands and FileSystem

Am I blocked on anything?
	- none
