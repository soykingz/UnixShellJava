What did I do last time?
	- Redesigned FileSystem with Tree and Node and generics base on Abbas' instruction


What do I plan to do now?
	- Finish implementing new Design of FileSystem
	- Override toString in my commands, FileSystem, Directory, IoHandler
	- Update Existing commands to work with updated generics and exceptions
	  version of FileSystem, Directory, File, IoHandler
	- JUnit test on existing commands and FileSystem, FileTree, Node, IoHandler
	- Separate the Recursive Traversing part from Ls -r and Tree

Am I blocked on anything?
