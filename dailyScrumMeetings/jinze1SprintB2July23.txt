What did I do last time?
	- Finished implementing new Design of JFileSystem with FileTree and Node
	- Overridden toString in my commands, JFileSystem, IoHandler, and commands
	- Updated Existing commands to work with updated generics and exceptions
	  version of FileSystem
	- JUnit tested on JFileSystem, FileTree, Node, IoHandler, Tree, Cat, 
	  Mkdir, Curl, UrlDownloader
	- Separated the Recursive Traversing part from Ls -r and Tree
	- updated command documentations

What do I plan to do now?

Am I blocked on anything?
