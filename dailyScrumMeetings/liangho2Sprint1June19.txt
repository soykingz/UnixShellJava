What did I do last time?
	- Discussed updated CRC card design with group
	- Changed JShell to fit with new design
	- Added shell package
	- Completed draft of Shell.java and CommandRedirectSplitter.java

What do I plan to do now?
	- Continue working on CommandInitializer
		- Get command and command construction
	- Dictionary for command validation to be used with CommandInitializer
	- Complete honour code for every java file so far

Am I blocked on anything?
	- Command needs to be completed before Shell and CommandInitializer can be finalized
	- FileSystem and IoHandler need to be completed for testing
