What did I do last time?
	- Completed draft of CommandInitializer.java
	- Completed draft of dictionary command searching
	- Updated references in Shell.java

What do I plan to do now?
	- Preliminary testing of shell package with FS before moving on (working with seyedayd and zinje1)
	- Further polishing/refactoring of shell package files
	- Product backlog refactoring
	- Sprint 2 backlog task completion (after the above)

Am I blocked on anything?
	- Command parent class and subclasses need to be completed before shell package files can run
	- FileSystem and IoHandler need to be completed for shell package files to run
