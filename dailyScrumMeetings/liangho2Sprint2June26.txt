What did I do last time?
	- Changed and refactored CommandInitializer to work better with current design
	- Completed skeleton code for Command (to be able to work on my specified subcommands)
	- Completed echo draft (argument parsing)

What do I plan to do now?
	- Further commands as specified in sprint backlog
		- Make sure all files adhere to Java coding style
	- Additional inter-file testing with group
		- Work together with other members to ensure command files are unified in design and format
	- Preparation for demo (function & polish of all files assigned to me)

Am I blocked on anything?
	- IoHandler files must be completed before Command superclass (and subclasses) can run
		- JShell and Shell also require IoHandler to run
