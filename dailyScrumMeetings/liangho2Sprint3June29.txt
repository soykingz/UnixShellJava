What did I do last time?
	- Completed Command, Cd, Echo, Ls, and Pwd
		- Ls and Pwd refactored to fit design requirements
	- Refactored shell files and JShell to work better with our design
		- Worked together with jinze1 to confirm that everything meshes functionally
		- Made changes to relevant group files to ensure functionality

What do I plan to do now?
	- Completion of last commands assigned to me as per sprint 3 backlog
	- Check Google coding style on all of my files
		- Javadoc for final version of completed files

Am I blocked on anything?
