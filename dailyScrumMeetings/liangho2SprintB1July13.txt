What did I do last time?
	- Refactored Cd, Ls, Shell, and JShell to catch and handle exceptions
		- Updated commands to use singleton design filesystem
	- Updated Ls draft to include recursive requirements
	- Updated Man to include new documentation
	- Discussed with jinze1 for an updated design for Shell, commands (using reflection), and JUnit tests

What do I plan to do now?
	- Update CommandInitializer to work with current reflection design
	- Refactor Shell to reduce line count
		- CRC Cards for possible new classes
	- JUnit and mock files for my files
	- Continue refactoring commands according to new filesystem design

Am I blocked on anything?
	- FileSystem and Directory's new designs must be finalized before command refactoring implementation can be tested with them.
