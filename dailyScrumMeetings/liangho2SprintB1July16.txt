What did I do last time?
	- Refactored all my files to fit design adjustments
		- Refactored Shell
			- Added CommandExecutor
		- Added multiple Exceptions for use with my shell files
		- Refactored commands to fit with filesystem and iohandler changes
	- Created mock files to test my commands
		- Created JUnit test files for all my commands

What do I plan to do now?
	- Create remaining JUnit test files for my shell files
	- Tasks as outlined in Sprint2B backlog
		-!number command
	- Continue refactoring old files further if necessary

Am I blocked on anything?
	- If any further design changes are implemented in filesystem and/or iohandler, they will have to be completed before I can test my own commands with them.
