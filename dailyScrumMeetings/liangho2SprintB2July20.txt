What did I do last time?
	- Refactored all my files to fit design adjustments
		- Refactored commands to fit with filesystem and iohandler changes
		- Updated CRC cards
	- Completed !NUM draft
		- Created JUnit test file for !NUM
		- Refactored Shell to work better with !NUM
			- Completed UserInputParser
			- Updated CommandExecutor
			- Updated CommandInitializer
			- Updated UserInputHistory
	- Added 2B command documentation to Man

What do I plan to do now?
	- Create remaining JUnit test files for my shell files
	- Continue refactoring old files further (pending considerable filesystem design changes)
		- Update mock files if necessary
		- Refactor ls
	- Assignment cleanup
		- Report file
		- Bonus (possibly)
		- Any last formatting changes in my files

Am I blocked on anything?
	- Considerable filesystem design changes must be implemented before I can test my refactored code with them.
