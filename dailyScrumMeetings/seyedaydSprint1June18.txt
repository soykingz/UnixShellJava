What did I do last time?
	-worked on filesystem (design) and the class responsible for the directories and nodes for it to store
	-discussed with my group members on an agreeable design (CRC cards) 

What do I plan to do now?
	-finish implementing the actual functionality of the file system
	-finish the node and directories class to build a chained directory

Am I blocked on anything?
