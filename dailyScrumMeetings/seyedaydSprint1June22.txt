What did I do last time?
    - Worked on File and FileSystem by implementing the classes based off CRC
    - Worked on having a directory class that should run as in the methods
      shouldn't have any errors(to note I wrote the directory basis off of
      the filesystem so I've somewhat created the basis for the filesystem
      to run off of).

What do I plan to do now?
    - help jinze1 if needed to finish FileSystem in 3 days
    - test that the directory class methods as well as (file)system methods
      work
    - I made a mistake in implementing the directory as it overlaps with the
      FileSystem so if jinze1 who is going to help fix the issues needs help
      or has any issues I'll be sure to help. As well as the File class not
      being the parent of the Directory class.

Am I blocked on anything?
    - I can't know if my classes don't 100% work until we have the FileSystem
      running as well as the shell being tested when creating the filesystem
