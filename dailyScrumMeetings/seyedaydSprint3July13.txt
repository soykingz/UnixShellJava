What did I do last time?
	- worked on trying to finish find from previous sprint
	- laid out the frame work to have it done by july 16th
	- joted down different test cases on a piece of paper

What do I plan to do now?
	- have a wokring find command
	- test cases that fully test the fully functionality of find
	- any new commands introduced if find is done early
	
Am I blocked on anything?
	- make directory might be buggy and might not allow me to easly test find
