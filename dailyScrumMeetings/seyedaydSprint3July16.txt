What did I do last time?
	- finished what I believe is a working copy of Find
	- implemented the structure for the test for it

What do I plan to do now?
	- communicate with teammates with what's left to do for the last sprint
	- finish any of the new commands assigned
	- finish any leftover testing needed to be done
	
Am I blocked on anything?
	- n/a
